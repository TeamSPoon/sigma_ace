1. Copy the latest SUMO file translated into Prolog clauses, kif.pl,
from the folder containing the readKIF.pl file, used to translate the
SUMO KIF file (kif.txt) into Prolog (kif.pl). The latest kif.pl file
should replace any previous one.

2. Copy WordNetMappings-Top.txt and WordNetMappings-verbs.txt from
CVS to get the latest files.

3. Run the PERL translation program wn2assoc3.perl on the annotated
noun WordNet file:

   perl WN2assoc3.perl WordNetMappings-Top.txt noun > mapped_nouns.pl

4. Run the PERL translation program wn2assoc3.perl on the annotated
verb WordNet file:
   
   perl WN2assoc3.perl WordNetMappings-verbs.txt verb > mapped_verbs.pl

5. Start SWI Prolog.

6. Run load_all to load all WordNet and other files:

   load_all.

7. Now run write_all_lexicon_files/0 to create the the three CELT
files: one for common nouns, one for proper nouns, and one for verbs.

This took about 15 minutes on my 600 Mhz PC at work on June 25, 2002:

write_all_lexicon_files.
% 2,132,068 inferences in 307.21 seconds (6940 Lips)
% 15,557,465 inferences in 474.51 seconds (32786 Lips)
% 14,393,030 inferences in 67.44 seconds (213429 Lips)

8. Drop copies of these three files into the latest version of CELT.
