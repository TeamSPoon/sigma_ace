How To RUN ACE

1. Edit the filename in load_sigma in ACE_TEST.SWI
to point to where your copy of the Sigma_Server.P
file is. Similarly, edit the filenames in 

  load_ontologies_SUMO, to point to the Standard Upper Ontology

  load_ontologies_FINANCE, to point to the Financial Ontology

  load_ontologies_BLOCKS, to point to the Blocks World Ontology.

These ontology files should be in a kbs folder that
is beneath the folder where sigma_server.P is located.

Use CVS tags to retrieve the proper versions of the SUMO
and financial ontology (e.g., "Blocks Demo Version 1.0")

1. Load the main ACE file (ACE.SWI)
into SWI Prolog.

2. Load ACE_TEST.SWI.

3. Run load_sigma_all.

4. Run blocks_suite(yes).
